## Working with Commands

Once inside the terminal, users can run a wide range of commands to manage their add-on effectively. Some commonly used commands include:

- **ls**: List directory contents.
- **pwd**: Print the current working directory.
- **df**: Display disk space usage.
- **du**: Estimate file space usage.

Users can execute these commands and more to inspect files, manage directories, monitor resource usage, and perform various administrative tasks within their add-on's environment.



The best part is that the terminal feature includes a convenient selection of commonly used commands, each accompanied by a description of its functionality. This makes it easy for users to find and execute commands, even if they don't remember the exact name. Some of these pre-added commands include **PS, FREE, DU**, and **PRINTENV**, providing users with essential tools for managing their add-ons effectively.





## Benefits of the Terminal Feature

- **Efficient Resource Management**: The terminal provides direct access to add-on resources, allowing users to manage files, directories, and system processes efficiently.
- **Streamlined Workflow**: By executing commands directly within the add-on's environment, users can streamline their workflow and perform tasks without switching between different interfaces or platforms.
- **Enhanced Control**: With access to the command line interface, users have greater control over their add-on's environment, enabling them to troubleshoot issues, install dependencies, and customize configurations as needed.

In summary, the terminal feature in PipeOps offers a powerful interface for managing add-ons, enabling users to execute commands directly within their add-on's environment and streamline their workflow effectively. Whether inspecting files, monitoring resources, or performing administrative tasks, the terminal provides a versatile and efficient tool for add-on management.
