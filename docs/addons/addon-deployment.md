# Deploying An Add-on

To deploy an add-on, first log in to your [PipeOps dashboard](https://console.pipeops.io/auth/signup). Then, click on the "**Addons**" option in the sidebar navigation menu on the left side of your screen. You will be redirected to the Add-ons store page, where you can select the add-on you want to deploy.

## View Add-on Details

"After selecting the add-on you want to deploy, you will be redirected to the add-on's details and description page, where you will find:

- A detailed description of the add-on,
- Information about the author of the add-on, and
- Any dependencies required for the add-on (if applicable).

Once you’ve confirmed it’s the correct add-on, click the "**Deploy App**" button to proceed to the next page, where you can configure the add-on for deployment."

## Configure Add-on

On this page, you can do the following:

- Select the server where you want to deploy your add-on,
- Choose the environment (e.g., beta, development, or production). [Learn more about environments here](/docs/how-to-guides/tutorials/managing-environments),
- View the resources required to deploy the add-on and the resources available to you,
- Add additional add-ons to deploy alongside the current one, and
- Review and modify the current configuration settings.

Once you’ve fully configured the add-on, click the "**Deploy**" button to begin deployment. Upon successful deployment, a success modal will appear. Click the "**Got it**" button to proceed to the [Add-on Overview Page](/docs/addons/addon-overview) for the add-on you just deployed. Alternatively, you can navigate to the [Add-on Overview Page](/docs/addons/addon-overview) while the deployment is still in progress by clicking the "**Skip**" button."
