# AddOns
This guide outlines the steps to deploy an add-on in PipeOps. The Add-ons section provides a variety of tools to enhance your projects. From databases to analytics tools, add-ons seamlessly extend your application's functionality.


## Deploying An Add-on
- To deploy an add-on, first log in to your [PipeOps dashboard](https://console.pipeops.io/auth/signup). 
- Click on the "**Addons**" option in the sidebar navigation menu on the left side of your screen. This takes you to the Add-ons marketplace.
