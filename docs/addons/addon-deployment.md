# AddOns
This guide outlines the steps to deploy an add-on in PipeOps. The Add-ons section provides a variety of tools to enhance your projects. From databases to analytics tools, add-ons seamlessly extend your application's functionality.


## Deploying An Add-on
- To deploy an add-on, first log in to your [PipeOps dashboard](https://console.pipeops.io/auth/signup). 
- Click on the "**Addons**" option in the sidebar navigation menu on the left side of your screen. This takes you to the Add-ons marketplace.
- Browse the available add-ons and choose the one you want to deploy. 
- Click on the add-on to view its details.


## Review Add-on Details

On the add-on's details page, you'll find:

- A detailed description of the add-on's functionality.

- Information about the add-on's creator or provider.

- Any required dependencies.

Once you’ve confirmed it’s the correct add-on, click the "**Deploy App**" button to proceed to the configuration page.


## Configure Add-on

On the configuration page, you can do the following:

- Select the server where you want to deploy your add-on
- Choose the environment (e.g., beta, development, or production)  
[Learn more about environments here](/docs/how-to-guides/tutorials/managing-environments)
- View the resources required to deploy the add-on and the resources available to you
- Add additional add-ons to deploy alongside the current one
- Review and modify the current configuration settings

## Deploy Add-on
- Once you’ve fully configured the add-on, click the "**Deploy**" button to begin deployment. 
- Upon successful deployment, a success modal will appear. Click the "**Got it**" button to proceed to the Overview Page of the add-on you just deployed. 
- Alternatively, you can skip waiting for the deployment to complete and navigate to the [Add-on Overview Page](/docs/addons/addon-overview) immediately by clicking the **Skip** button.
