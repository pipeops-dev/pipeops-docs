# Customizing Default Domain Name

When you deploy an add-on on PipeOps, it comes with a randomly generated project name, such as `familiar-team-thoughtless.pipeops.app`. But wouldn't it be great to have a custom and memorable domain like `https://shopmart.pipeops.app`? With PipeOps, you can easily set a unique domain for your project.

## Steps to Customize Your PipeOps Default Domain

Follow these simple steps to set up a custom PipeOps domain for your add-on:

1. **Navigate to Your Add-on**

   - Log in to your [PipeOps dashboard](https://console.pipeops.io/auth/signin) and select the add-on for which you want to change the domain name.

2. **Access Add-on Settings**

   - Click on the `Settings` tab of your add-on.

   - From the settings menu, select `Domains`.

4. **Rename Your Project**

   - Enter your desired custom domain name.
