# Customizing Your PipeOps Default Domain Name

When you deploy your application on PipeOps, it comes with a randomly generated project name, such as `familiar-team-thoughtless.pipeops.app`. But wouldn't it be great to have a custom and memorable domain like `https://shopmart.pipeops.app`? With PipeOps, you can easily set a unique domain for your project.


## Steps to Customize Your PipeOps Default Domain

Follow these simple steps to set a custom PipeOps name for your project:

1. **Navigate to Your Project**

   - Log in to your [PipeOps dashboard](https://console.pipeops.io/auth/signin) and select the project for which you want to change the domain name.

2. **Access Project Settings**

   - Click on the `Settings` tab of your project.

3. **Open General Settings**

   - From the settings menu, select `General Settings`.

4. **Rename Your Project**

   - Enter your desired name.

5. **Save and Redeploy**
   - Save your changes and wait for the project to redeploy with the new name.



### Custom Domain Name


PipeOps also allows you to set a custom domain name (e.g., yourcompany.com) for your application. This makes it easy to access your application from a user-friendly web address. Your custom domain name will direct traffic to your deployment's HTTPS load balancer endpoint.


Follow these steps to set a custom web address:

1. Navigate to your project and click on the "Settings" tab.

2. From the settings menu, select `Domains`.

## Conclusion

That's it! Now your project is accessible via your personalized URL. Enjoy the convenience and branding benefits of having a custom domain for your PipeOps project.
