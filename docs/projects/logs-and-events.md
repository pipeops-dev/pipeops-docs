Logs are detailed records of system activities and events occurring within a project's environment. These logs provide valuable insights into the operation, performance, and health of the project, facilitating troubleshooting, monitoring, and analysis processes.

Logs are classified based on timeline and severity levels, and users can search for specific activities or events. PipeOps provides several features to help users leverage logs effectively:

2. **Time-Based Filtering:** PipeOps offers a timeline view of logs, allowing users to track the sequence of events and identify any patterns or trends. You can view logs from different timeframes, including relative periods (e.g., last 15 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day). You can also specify a custom date range for more precise analysis.

2. **Search Functionality**: PipeOps includes a powerful search function that lets users quickly find specific log entries. Whether troubleshooting an error or auditing system activities, the search feature streamlines the process and saves time.

3. **Customization Options**: Users can customize log settings in PipeOps to tailor the display according to their preferences. This includes filtering logs based on specific criteria, adjusting the level of detail shown, and setting alerts for critical events.
