# Project History

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to exploring and utilizing the project history feature within PipeOps. With PipeOps, you can seamlessly access detailed deployment records and insightful project history, enabling you to track the evolution of your projects and streamline deployment processes effectively.

## Prerequisites

To view Project history in PipeOps, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **A PipeOps account**. Use the link [here](https://console.pipeops.io/signup) to sign up on PipeOps if you do not currently have an account.
2. **A deployed project**. This can be a PipeOps template or a project from your Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) account. You can select a PipeOps template [here](https://github.com/orgs/pipeops-dev/repositories).

## Viewing Project History

To view project history:

- Navigate to your project's main page in PipeOps.
- Click on the "History" tab to access the project settings dashboard.

Your deployment history consists of the following information per each deployment:

- **Build SHA:** This shows the version of your app that was used in each deployment. It's like a unique ID for the build, so you can see exactly which version of the app was deployed.
- **Commit SHA:** This is a specific code change in your project's history, like a snapshot of the code at a particular time. Each deployment is linked to one of these commits, so you can see exactly what changes were made before deployment.
- **URL:** If your project has a custom web address, it'll show up here. This makes it easy to access your app directly. If there's no custom address, it'll say "N/A."
- **Author:** This tells you what action triggered the deployment. It usually shows a short message about what was done, so you know what started the deployment process. For instance, if you redeployed, you'll see "redeployment" under Author.
- **Created at:** This shows when the deployment occured. It gives you a timeline of deployments, so you can see when things were done and spot any patterns.
- **Status:** This tells you if the deployment was successful or if there were any issues. It's an important way to check if everything went smoothly with each deployment.
