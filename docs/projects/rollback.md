# Rollback

This guide introduces PipeOps' rollback feature for easy deployment management. Recent updates offer a user-friendly option with visual confirmation for swift reversals and notifications for conflicts. Detailed logs aid monitoring, and integration with monitoring tools provides real-time insights.

## Prerequisites

1. **A PipeOps account**. Use the link [here](https://console.pipeops.io/signup) to sign up on PipeOps if you do not currently have an account.
2. **A deployed project**. This can be a PipeOps template or a project from your Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) account. You can select a PipeOps template [here](https://github.com/orgs/pipeops-dev/repositories).

## Accessing Rollback

To access Rollback:

1. Navigate to your project's main page in PipeOps.
2. Select the “**Actions**” button to access the project actions dropdown menu.
3. Click on the "**Rollback**" button to trigger a rollback.

- **Detailed Logging**: PipeOps offers detailed logs for all rollback operations, allowing users to monitor progress and track changes effectively.

- **Manual Version Selection**: Users have the flexibility to manually select a previous version for rollback, providing full control over deployment management.
