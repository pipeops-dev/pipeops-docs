## Filtering Options
The Nodes tab offers filtering options to help you narrow down and focus on specific nodes:

- **Periods:** Allows you to filter the data based on different time periods.


Each node includes the following information:

- **Name:** The name or identifier of the node.
- **Roles:** The functions the node performs within the cluster, such as worker nodes or control plane nodes.
- **External/Internal IP:** The external and internal IP addresses of the node.
- **CPU:** The CPU utilization of the node.
- **RAM:** The RAM utilization of the node.
- **Pods:** Number of pods running on the node. Pods represent one or more application containers.
- **Status:** The current status of the node (e.g., running, stopped).
