# Server Metrics

## Overview

This documentation guides you through the process of accessing and exploring metrics for your deployed servers using PipeOps.

PipeOps allows users to gain valuable insights into the performance of deployed servers. By analyzing key metrics, you can identify potential issues, ensure efficient resource allocation, and maintain overall system health.

## Accessing Server Metrics

To view the metrics for your server, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Servers** section.
2. Select the desired server from the list.
3. Click on the **Metrics** tab to open the metrics dashboard.

The image above illustrates the server metrics overview, offering a quick glimpse of how your server is performing across various metrics.

## Exploring Individual Metrics

The **Metrics** dashboard includes various performance indicators that can help you monitor resource usage. Each one is represented by detailed graphs and data points. Let's explore some key metrics available:

### CPU Metric

The CPU metric displays real-time CPU utilization. It helps you understand the processing power consumed by your server. Here's an example of how the CPU metric might be visualized:
