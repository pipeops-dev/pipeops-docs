The image above illustrates the server metrics overview, offering a quick glimpse of how your server is performing across various metrics.

## Exploring Individual Metrics

The **Metrics** dashboard includes various performance indicators that can help you monitor resource usage. Each one is represented by detailed graphs and data points. Let's explore some key metrics available:

### CPU Metric

The CPU metric displays real-time CPU utilization. It helps you understand the processing power consumed by your server. Here's an example of how the CPU metric might be visualized:
