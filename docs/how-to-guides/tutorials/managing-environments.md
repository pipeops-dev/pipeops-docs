# Environments in PipeOps

This documentation provides an overview of working with environments in PipeOps. Environments allow you to manage different configurations and settings for your projects, facilitating testing, development, and production workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before delving into viewing and manipulating Environments, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **A PipeOps account**. Use the link [here](https://console.pipeops.io/signup) to sign up on PipeOps if you do not currently have an account.
2. **A deployed project**. This can be a PipeOps template or a project from your Git (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket) account. You can select a PipeOps template [here](https://github.com/orgs/pipeops-dev/repositories).

## Accessing Environments

Environments refer to different configurations and settings that allow for the management of projects in various stages, such as testing, development, and production. These environments help facilitate workflows by providing distinct setups tailored to different purposes.

To view the list of available environments and switch between them, follow these steps:

- Click on the **New** button on the upper right side of your screen and select the “**Environments**” option from the dropdown menu. You have 2 environments automatically created for you by default.
- To have access to unlimited environments, consider upgrading to the growth plan.

To edit your environment, select Edit Environment from the dropdown menu beside any of your environments.
