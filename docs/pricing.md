## Usage-Based Pricing
Use PipeOps to the fullest and access all the platform's features while only paying for the resources you consume. We operate on a usage-based pricing model, meaning you are billed only for your actual cloud resource consumption at the end of each billing cycle. This approach eliminates fixed resource classes, giving you the flexibility to scale resources as needed.


## FAQs

### Is there a free trial?
Yes! New users receive a 14-day free trial upon signing up. During this period, you can explore PipeOps and its features. After the trial period, you will be billed based on the subscription tier you selected.

### What's the difference between subscription and resource usage?

Your subscription gives you access to the PipeOps platform and its features, while resource usage refers to the actual resources consumed by your deployments. Subscription costs are fixed while resource usage costs vary based on what you use.

Absolutely. You can switch between plans at any time based on your needs. Changes take effect at the start of the next billing cycle.

### Can I use PipeOps without a paid subscription?
Yes! You can continue using PipeOps for free by connecting to a supported cloud provider. However, access to advanced features will be limited, and essential operations (like topping up deployments) will follow a pay-as-you-go model.
