# Pricing 

PipeOps Plans and Pricing are designed to meet the needs of businesses of all sizes. We offer a transparent usage-based pricing model, so you can scale with no unexpected costs. Whether you're an individual developer, a growing startup, or a large organization, our pricing tiers ensure you only pay for the resources you use.


## Usage-based Pricing
Use PipeOps to the fullest and access all the platform's features while only paying for the resources you consume. We operate on a usage-based pricing model, meaning you are billed only for your actual cloud resource consumption at the end of each billing cycle. This approach eliminates fixed resource classes, giving you the flexibility to scale resources as needed.


## Subscription Plans
PipeOps offers three subscription plans:

## Yearly Pricing Plan
PipeOps offers a discounted yearly payment option for users who prefer to pay annually rather than monthly. Here’s how it works:

### How Yearly Payments Work
The yearly payment option provides a **20% discount** on your subscription. 

Let’s break this down using the Growth Plan as an example:

The standard monthly fee for the Growth tier is ₦15,500, which adds up to ₦186,000 for 12 months. 
With the yearly plan payment, users receive a 20% discount, which brings the total discounted amount to ₦148,800.

When you pay ₦148,800 for a yearly plan:

- ₦12,400 is immediately applied to cover the first month’s subscription.  
- The remaining ₦136,400 is credited to your PipeOps wallet and used automatically for monthly renewals.

### How Billing Works on a Yearly Plan
Although you pay upfront, PipeOps still processes your subscription monthly to align with Nova usage billing cycles.

**Example:**

In the case of the Growth Plan, ₦12,400 is automatically deducted from your wallet each month to renew your subscription.   
This continues for the remaining 11 months, as long as your wallet balance is sufficient and your Nova usage stays within the plan’s covered amount.


### What Happens If You Exceed the Covered Nova Usage?

If your resource usage for the month exceeds the coverage included in your plan:

- The extra charges will be deducted from your wallet balance.

- This will reduce the amount available for future monthly renewals.

Other expenses on the platform, such as deployment top-ups and team seat top-ups, will also be charged from your wallet balance.

If your wallet runs out due to high usage, you'll need to fund it to avoid service interruptions.






## Payment Methods
PipeOps supports a variety of payment methods to accommodate users across different regions:

1. **Paystack** - Best for Local Payments

    - Card Payments: Pay securely using debit or credit cards.

    - Bank Transfers: Make payments directly from your bank account.

    - USSD: Use USSD codes for quick and convenient payments.

    - PayAttitude: Pay directly from your phone number.


2. **Stripe** - Best for International Payments

    - Card Payments: Accepts major credit and debit cards, including Visa, Mastercard, and American Express.

    - Cash App Pay: A convenient option for Cash App users.

    - US Bank Accounts: Direct payments from US-based bank accounts.

These options ensure that PipeOps users, whether local or international, have access to secure and flexible payment solutions. You can select your preferred method during checkout.





## FAQs

### Is there a free trial?
Yes! New users receive a 14-day free trial upon signing up. During this period, you can explore PipeOps and its features. After the trial period, you will be billed based on the subscription tier you selected.

### What's the difference between subscription and resource usage?

Your subscription gives you access to the platform and its features and includes a fixed amount of covered Nova usage. If your monthly resource consumption stays within your plan’s coverage, you won’t pay anything extra. However, if you exceed it, you’ll only be billed for the excess at the end of your billing cycle.

### Which plan is best for me?
- **Growth Tier:** Ideal for small teams or individual developers who need essential features and affordability.

- **Scale Tier:** Suitable for expanding teams requiring advanced features like integration with multiple cloud providers, multiple environments, and additional team seats.

- **Custom Tier:** Best for larger businesses with unique requirements, offering tailored features and enterprise compliance. Users can customize features from the Growth and Scale tiers to perfectly match their business needs.


### Can I upgrade or downgrade at any time?
Absolutely. You can switch between plans at any time based on your needs. Changes take effect at the start of the next billing cycle.
